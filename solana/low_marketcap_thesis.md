# Introduction

I have been watching [$HABIBI](https://dexscreener.com/solana/2ukgjDC99Nk34RfRjWjCoHAuQLtLnz8TLcBrDQk3f2ay) since its mid-day inception on March 30, 2024. The totaly supply of $HABIBI is 1 billion, meaning the current price is reflective of it's market cap valuation. The coin quickly pumped to it's all time high (ATH) of $3 million market cap two and a half hours after launch before quickly coming down to around $400,000 market cap. Over the course of the next few days, the coin would hover around around $600,000 market cap, but it would periodically pump between $1 - 2 million market cap. The most notable observation that I made was how the market moved around buy or sell transactions that were only between $1000-5000. This document contains research regarding this phenomena.
